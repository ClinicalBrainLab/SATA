# Systematic Approach for tDCS analysis (SATA) is a Matlab Based toolbox.
# ** SATA is a post-processing toolbox after tDCS montages have been simulated in COMETS or ROAST
# to download the GUI version of SATA plese visit https://doi.org/10.21979/N9/DMWPZK



## Installation

The complete installation guide for SATA software package is availaible in the reference manual

############# Features
# Input Features
- [1] Takes the montages simulated from COMETS or ROAST (Please cite the respective references based on your choice)

# Output Features
- [1] Current density in each cortical Lobe - Amount of stimulation received in each cortical area of the brain
- [2] Overlap - If there are multiple cortical routes that process the information (e.g., Dorsal and venntral routes in Language, Vision, etc) in the brain, SATA helps to decide the montage that is most appropriate so that user can stimulate one route thereby minimally stimulating the other or can also chose the montage that stimulates both routes.

#### Overall use of SATA

- [1] Solves the ambiguities in montage selection
- [2] Aids selection of Appropriate tDCS Montage
